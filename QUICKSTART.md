# Harbor Satellite Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Harbor Satellite Quick Start Guide! This guide provides a clear and streamlined process to set up and start using Harbor Satellite quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A **Harbor registry instance** with the satellite adapter installed. You can the instance [here](https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-next/tree/satellite).
- **Credentials** with permission to create robot accounts in the registry

- The latest version of **Dagger** installed. [Download and install Dagger](https://docs.dagger.io/install).
- (Optional) **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for non-Dagger setups. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Step 1: Configure Ground Control

Ground Control is the central service that manages satellite configurations. Let’s set it up.

1. Clone the Harbor Satellite repository (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-satellite.git
   cd harbor-satellite
   ```
2. Navigate to the `ground-control` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ground-control
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file using the provided example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

   ```env
   # Harbor Registry Credentials
   HARBOR_USERNAME=admin
   HARBOR_PASSWORD=Harbor12345
   HARBOR_URL=https://demo.goharbor.io

   # Ground Control Settings
   PORT=8080
   APP_ENV=local

   # Database Settings (Use DB_HOST=pgservice for Dagger)
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=groundcontrol
   DB_USERNAME=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=password
   ```

   > **Note:** _Ensure the database is running and accessible. For Dagger, set `DB_HOST=pgservice`._

## Step 2: Start Ground Control

Choose one of the following options to start Ground Control

**Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for End Users)**

1. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `ground-control` directory with the same credentials as in the `.env` file.
   
2. Start Ground Control :
   
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   > **Tip:** _Use `-d` to run in detached mode. Verify the service is running with `docker ps`._

**Option 2: Build and Run Binary (Alternative for End Users)**

1. Build the Ground Control binary:

   ```bash
   dagger call build-dev --platform "linux/amd64" --component "ground-control" export --path=./gc-dev
   ```

2. Run the binary:

   ```bash
   ./gc-dev
   ```

**Option 3: Using Dagger (Recommended for Developers)**

1. Start Ground Control with Dagger:

   ```bash
   dagger call run-ground-control up
   ```

## Step 3: Verify Ground Control Health

Check if Ground Control is running

   ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```


A `200 OK` response indicates Ground Control is healthy.

## Step 4: Create a Group for Artifacts

A **group** is just a set of images that the satellite needs to replicate from the upstream registry.It also consists information about all the artifacts present in it.

> **Note:** _You must modify the body given below according to your registry._


Use the following `curl` command to create a group. Modify the JSON body to match your registry and artifacts:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/groups/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "group": "group1",
    "registry": "https://demo.goharbor.io",
    "artifacts": [
      {
        "repository": "satellite/alpine",
        "tag": ["latest"],
        "type": "docker",
        "digest": "sha256:5a6ee6c36824d527a0fe91a2a7c160c2e286bbeae46cd931c337ac769f1bd930",
        "deleted": false
      }
    ]
  }'
```


> **Note:** _Replace `repository`, `tag`, and `digest` with your artifact details. Use `docker inspect` or Harbor's UI to find the digest._

## Step 5: Configure the Satellite

Now you need to create a config artifact for the satellite. An example is given [example](https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-satellite/blob/main/examples/config.json). This artifact tells the satellite where the ground control is located and defines how and when to replicate artifacts from it. It also includes details about the local OCI-compliant registry, specified separately under its own field.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/configs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "config_name": "config1",
  "registry": "http://demo.goharbor.io", # your registry URL here
  "config":
{ 
    "state_config": {},
    "app_config": {
        "ground_control_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
        "log_level": "info",
        "use_unsecure": true,
        "zot_config_path": "./registry_config.json",
        "state_replication_interval": "@every 00h00m10s",
        "update_config_interval": "@every 00h00m10s",
        "register_satellite_interval": "@every 00h00m10s",
        "local_registry": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8585"
        }
    },
    "zot_config": {
        "distSpecVersion": "1.1.0",
        "storage": {
            "rootDirectory": "./zot"
        },
        "http": {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "8585"
        },
        "log": {
            "level": "info"
        }
      }
}
}
'
```

> **Tip:** _Adjust `ground_control_url` and `local_registry.url` if running on a different host or port_.

## Step 6: Register the Satellite

Register the satellite with the group and configuration created earlier. This request returns a token, which you must save for the next step:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/satellites' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "satellite_1",
    "groups": ["group1"],  # name of the group you created
    "config_name": "config1" # name of the config you created
}'
```

> **Important**: Copy the token from the response. _Where will you store this token to ensure it’s secure and accessible?_

## Step 7: Start the Satellite

Set up the satellite using the token from Step 6. Choose one of the following options: Example [here](https://github.com/container-registry/harbor-satellite/blob/main/.env.example)

**Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for End Users)**

1. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root with the token and other required settings.
  
2. Ensure Ground Control and the satellite are on the same network if Ground Control isn’t on a public IP.
3. Start the satellite:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**Option 2: Using Dagger**

1. Build and export the satellite binary:

   ```bash
   dagger call build --source=. --component=satellite export --path=./bin
   ```

2. Run the binary with the token:
   
   ```bash
   ./bin --token "<your-token>" --ground-control-url "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
   ```

**Option 3: Using Go**

1. Run the satellite directly:
   
   ```bash
    go run cmd/main.go --token "<your token here>" --ground-control-url "<ground control url here>"
   ```


   > **Note** : by default, logging in JSON format is set to true.  To change this pass additional flag `--json-logging=false` 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider these common problems and solutions:

1. **Ground Control Connection Issues**
   - Verify the `ground_control_url` in the satellite configuration.
   - Check if Ground Control is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`.
   - Ensure environment variables match the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. **Registry Access Issues**
   - Confirm Harbor credentials (`HARBOR_USERNAME` and `HARBOR_PASSWORD`).
   - Test network connectivity to the Harbor registry: `ping demo.goharbor.io`.
   - Ensure the robot account has appropriate permissions in Harbor.
3. **Satellite Not Replicating Artifacts**
   - Verify the group and config names in the satellite registration.
   - Check the artifact digest and repository details in the group configuration..
   - Ensure the local registry (`http://127.0.0.1:8585`) is running.

> **Question**: Which of these issues seems most likely in your environment, and how will you verify it?
