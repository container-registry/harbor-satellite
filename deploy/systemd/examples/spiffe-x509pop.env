## SPIFFE X.509 Proof-of-Possession Authentication (Method 3)
## Hardware-bound identity using SPIRE agent with x509pop attestation
##
## Prerequisites:
## - SPIRE agent installed and running (spire-agent.service)
## - X.509 certificates pre-provisioned on device (manufacturing/bootstrap)
## - SPIRE agent configured for x509pop attestation
## - Install 10-spire-dependency.conf drop-in for service dependency
##
## Use this for:
## - Pre-provisioned hardware with embedded certificates
## - Manufacturing environments where devices receive certs during production
## - High-security deployments requiring hardware-bound identity
##
## Security: Hardware-bound identity with mTLS and SPIFFE SVIDs

## REQUIRED: Ground Control URL
GROUND_CONTROL_URL=https://ground-control.example.com:8080

## REQUIRED: Enable SPIFFE authentication
SPIFFE_ENABLED=true

## SPIFFE Workload API socket (default: unix:///run/spire/sockets/agent.sock)
SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET=unix:///run/spire/sockets/agent.sock

## REQUIRED: Expected SPIFFE ID of Ground Control server
SPIFFE_EXPECTED_SERVER_ID=spiffe://harbor-satellite.local/gc/main

## Token not required when SPIFFE is enabled
# TOKEN is not needed

## Optional: Logging
