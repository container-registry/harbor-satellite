## Why
Currently, we provide a static config.json file to the satellite. As we move forward, we may want to be able to update the satelliteâ€™s config remotely. This is not a straightforward change and it changes a lot of the existing code. This proposal outlines approaches that we may want to consider to solve this problem.

## Pitfalls of the current solution
Static config is fine, but in the long run, the needs of the user might change and more configurable fields might arise. This requires us to provide the ground control manager with the ability to update the satellite config dynamically.

## Goals
- Outline the use flow of dynamic configuration
- List the expectations from dynamic configuration
- Provide possible solutions to achieve the expectations

## Audience
- Developers of Harbor-Satellite
- Users of Harbor-Satellite

## Non-Goals
- Not meant as a technical guide for implementation

## How
This change will be in multiple phases:
1. How the config.json is stored upstream
2. How the config is updated by ground control
3. How the satellite updates itself with the newest config
4. How the satellite handles failed/wrong configurations
5. How the satellite starts up (if the config is stored upstream, we need another way to do ztr)
